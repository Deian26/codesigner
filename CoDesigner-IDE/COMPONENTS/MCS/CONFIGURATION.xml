		MiniComp Simulation
		This component adds the MiniComp hardware logic, communication protocols and I/O descriptions, needed for simulating MC &lt;-&gt; communication, to the built-in circuit simulator.
	</description>

	<simulation>
		<!-- Transport medium types are currently only defined in the IDE -->
		<transport-mediums>
			<!-- 
			Mandatory attributes for each sub-node ('transport-protocol') : name (string), parallel-bits (int-string), bus-sel (bool-string), port (string)
				
			Example: 
				MiniComp Transport Protocol; abstractly defines the protocol:
					- name = "MCTM" -> MiniComp Transport Medium; the name must be unique within the simulation
					- description = "MiniComp Transport Medium"
					- parallel-bits = "2" -> 2 bits being transmitted at the same time
					- sel = "true" -> if true, selection is used to secure the before transmitting data
			-->
			<transport-medium name="MCTM"
							description="MiniComp Transport Medium; bus medium"
							parallel-bits="2"
							sel="true"
			/> 
							    	
		</transport-mediums>

		<!-- Simulation elements -->
		<abstract-simulation-elements>
			<!-- 
			This node defines the simulation elements. Each sub-node defines an abstract element, which must contain a unique name (attribute 'name') within the simulation:
				- name (string; formal name, the displayed name can be different)
				- description
				- image-filepath (relative to the components' folder)
			
			The types of abstract elements supported by the IDE are defined below, with their attributes / sub-nodes (the 'name' (string) attribute is mandatory for all abstract elements):
					- uP; sub-nodes:
						(optional) 
							<power
								min-tension="int; volts" 
								max-tension="int; volts" 
								min-consumption="int; amps" 
								max-consumption="int; amps"/>
						
						(mandatory)
						<logic supports-floating-point="false" supports-programming="true"/>
						<ports>
							<port name="string; must be unique" 
									number="int-string; the number of ports of this type on the uP" 
									transport-mediums="string; a comma-separated list of supported transport mediums; they must also be defined in the 'transport-mediums' node"/>
							...
						</ports>
					
					(defined by the IDE; definitions here will be ignored)
					- logic-input; mandatory attributes: <logic-input name="" num-type="same as for 'sensor'" /> ; this element injects a value directly onto a transport-line; this element is supported by default by the IDE and may not be defined; if it is defined, its definition is ignored !
					- logic-output; this element displays the current value from the transport-line;  this element is supported by default by the IDE and may not be defined; if it is defined, its definition is ignored !
					- note; this element displays a note (comment) and has no other function; this element is supported by default by the IDE and may not be defined; if it is defined, its definition is ignored !
				
				E.g.: 
				<uP name="Element1">
					...
				</uP>

			<uP name="MC" description="MiniComp microprocessor" image-filepath="Resources/MC_uC_BlueprintImg.jpg"> <!-- Defines a Mini Comp uP -->
